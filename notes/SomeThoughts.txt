Some thoughts after reading the code from OpenGL-Compute git repos:
(2) Beware of the memory layout, there's a hunch that the padding might be inconsistent?
(3) If a color of a triangle already set, meaning 3 vertices have the color red, there is a chance that one
	of the vertex will have its color overwritten because it also a part of other triangles, might be 6 in
	total?
(4) Ok, but why is there a y offset though?

Some thoughts from reading the Nvidia rigid body simulation paper:
(1) A voxel is defined by 1 coordinate (x, y, z) and its side length. More specifically, the smallest coordinates + side length.
(2) Use however many SSBO's needed to store physical values of a rigid body: position, linear momentum, angular momentum, orientation quaternion, etc
(3) An index is assigned to each rigid body. Basically, an entity's ID number.
(4) Since each rigid body is made out of multiple particles, each particle also need to have its physical values stores in multiple SSBO's.
(5) Indices of the particles that belong to a rigid body are calculated from the rigid body index.
(6) How is a particle defined? A position (vec3) and a radius?

Source: Thinking Parallel, Part III: Tree Construction on the GPU - by Tero Karras
(1) One thread per object: Calculate bounding box and assign Morton code
(2) Parallel radix sort: Sort the objects according to their Morton codes
(3) One thread per internal node: Generate BVH node hierarchy
(4) One thread per object: Calculate node bounding boxes by walking the hierarchy toward the root
(5) One thread per object: Find potential collisions by traversing the BVH

Broad-phase: a bunch of Shapes -> dispatch compute to calculate a bunch of AABBs -> construct a BVH tree (CPU/GPU)

What is a BVH tree? A collection of Node structs; each Node contains 1 left child, 1 right child, and its AABB
	if it is a internal node; if it is a leaf node, it has no children but it has AABB of the object in the physics world.
What does this mean on the GPU, i.e. in terms of SSBOs? We can have multiple SSBOs, i.e. left children SSBO, right children
	SSBO (Struct of arrays, SoA), to identify which node the attributes belong to, we use index. E.g, each node has an index
	in the tree, we can use that index to reference which SSBO index.

Some concerns:
	There are limited number of work groups, think about them as threads. Some GPU has small amount of work groups,
	so if the number of objects in the world is way more than the number of work groups allow, how should we solve this
	issue? How to make it more robust? GTX 965M can have like up to ~2 mil (not sure - x:2147483647 y:65535 z:65535)
	work groups, so shouldn't be that bad.
